## Supported Features
### Types
- `reg` is any one of the registers `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `H`, `L`, or `M` (memory at register pair HL).
- `rp` is a register pair, these include registers `B`, `D`, and `H`. Some instructions may accept `SP` or `PSW` as a register pair.
- `d16` is either a 2 byte string literal, 16-bit number, a label, or an expression.
- `a16` is either a 16 bit number, a label, or an expression.
- `d8` is either a 1 byte string literal, 8-bit number, an 8-bit label, or an expression.
